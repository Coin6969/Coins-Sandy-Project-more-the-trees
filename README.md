# Coin's Sandy Shores Project (more than just trees)

I know it has been a long time since I've made a ymap for FiveM, but here it is. Instead of starting from scratch, I've used the CoinsTrees ymap (my last ymap) as a base and built up on it. You'll find small changes around sandy shores, making your life easier and making Sandy look cleaner and better. You will find shrines for fallen soldiers, less mud and dirt on the roads and secret little hidden objects found around the map and so much more. This project is primarily made for a server Horizon Roleplay but is being made public for every server to use. In later updates there will be object added to the map in commemoration with Horizon members.
