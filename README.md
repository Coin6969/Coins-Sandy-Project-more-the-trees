# Coin's Sandy Shores Project (more than just trees)

I know it has been a long time since I've made a ymap for FiveM, but here it is. Instead of starting from scratch, I've used the CoinsTrees ymap (my last ymap) as a base and built up on it. You'll find small changes around sandy shores, making your life easier and making Sandy look cleaner and better. You will find shrines for fallen soldiers, less mud and dirt on the roads, secret little hidden objects around the map, and so much more. This project is primarily made for a server NBN Roleplay, but is being made public for every server to use. In later updates, objects will be added to the map in commemoration of NBN members.
